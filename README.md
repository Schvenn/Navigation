# Navigation
Powershell module to enhance CLI navigation with bookmarks, history, autocompletion and more.

This module was created in response to my desire to make navigating within PowerShell on Windows much more convenient, by adding additional functionality to speed up many command line interactions. Yes, it has been designed with Windows in mind and while a lot of the features will likely work on xNix based systems as well, they have not been tested and I have no idea how well they would work. Some features, like the Explorer functionality, will obviously not work at all outside of Windows.

This started as a simple goto function that allowed me to quickly navigate to any directory on my computer, regardless of which drive it was located on, without having to memorize entire paths or navigate up and down several directories. As anyone who has worked in a shell for any length of time knows, the pain of navigation is real and often entails a lot of change directory commands, followed by listing the directory structure, the another change directory, and so on.

That becomes very cumbersome and so, this project began with simple origins, but kept growing into a larger, far more comprehensive package until now, it is a full suite of navigational tools that helps beginners and power users alike move around within PowerShell much quicker than they normally can; faster even than using Windows Explorer.
